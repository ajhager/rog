* Depends only on skelterjohn/go.wde.
* 24bit, unicode console with built in font.

Plans
-----
* User supplied font sets and tilemaps.
* Documentation and tutorials.
* Test suite.
* Noise generators.
* Image scale and rotation.
* Console to console blitting.

Notes
-----
* On Windows you can build your project with `go build -ldflags -Hwindowsgui` to inhibit the console window that pops up by default.
