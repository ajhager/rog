termbox backend for github.com/ajhager/rog
=========================================
* Generally working but needs polishing.
* Keyboard is barely functioning.
* 24 bit color to 16 color ANSI works but isn't perfect.
* Might pull in https://github.com/swdunlop/termbox-go for 256 color support.
* See https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go for issues.
